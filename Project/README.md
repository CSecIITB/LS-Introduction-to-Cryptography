# The Final Project

## Part 1 - Vigenère Cracker

Write a script to input a Vigenère-encrypted ciphertext and print the plaintext and key. 

### Constraints
The input ciphertext will only contain lower case letters, spaces and punctuations. The spaces and punctuations are not encrypted.

### Verifying your solution
You can use these three sample test cases to verify your code. You may use Python, C or C++ to write your program.

### Submission instruction
Create a file `script.py`/`script.c`/`script.cpp` which solves the challenge.
