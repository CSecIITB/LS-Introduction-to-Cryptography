# The Final Project

## Part 1 - Vigenère Cracker

Write a script to input a Vigenère-encrypted ciphertext and print the plaintext and key. Find out how to perform cryptanalysis on the Vignère cipher using Google or elsewhere.

### Constraints
The input ciphertext will only contain lower case letters, spaces and punctuations. The spaces and punctuations are not encrypted. You may use Python, C or C++ to write your script.

### Verifying your solution
You can use [these three sample test cases](./samples.txt) to verify your code. 

### Submission instruction
Create a file `script.py`/`script.c`/`script.cpp` which solves the challenge.
