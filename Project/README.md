# The Final Project

## Part 1 - Vigenère Cracker

Write a script to input a Vigenère-encrypted ciphertext and print the plaintext and key. The input ciphertext will only contain lower case letters, spaces and punctuations, and the spaces and punctuations are not encrypted.

You can use these three sample test cases to verify your code. You may use Python, C or C++ to write your program.

### Submission instruction
Create a file `script.py`/`script.c`/`script.cpp` which solves the challenge. The first line of this file should contain a comment with the flag you obtained.
