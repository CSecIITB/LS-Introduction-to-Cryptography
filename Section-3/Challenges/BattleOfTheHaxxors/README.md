# BattleOfTheHaxxors
Kevin Mitnick is plotting to hide the flag away from Kristina Svechinskaya in a desperate attempt to stop her from completing YoS. To that end, Mitnick decided to encrypt the flag. However, the resourceful Svechinskaya was closing in far. A frantic Mitnick decided to erase the keys and the flag that was encrypted. Alas, she could only get back the remaining code. She suspected that they could retreive the flag in cleartext. Can you help Svechinskaya?

The flag format is ```YoS{...}```.
